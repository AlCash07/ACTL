# ACTL

ACTL library aims to provide accessible generic implementation
of advanced algorithms not available in the C++ standard library,
and also improve the ones available there if possible.

ACTL stands for Algorithm Competition Template Library,
because competitive programming was the original inspiration,
but the content has much wider applicability.

[Documentation](https://alcash07.github.io/ACTL/)
is one of our top priorities, please check it out.
