********************************

ACTL started as a template library for algorithm competitions,
but ended up providing numerous widely applicable components.

Design
================================

These design decisions affect a large portion of the library,
so it's useful to understand them:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   actl/meta/constant

Contents
================================

Sub-libraries that emerged as helper utilities and can be used in various contexts:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   actl/functional
   actl/meta
   actl/memory
   actl/platform
   actl/preprocessor

Thematic libraries focused on a specific topic:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   actl/string

Contributing
================================

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1
